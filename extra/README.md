This folder contains notebooks used to generate the inverse kinematics data
from pose estimation results. The exact is outside the scope of the demo
tutorials but we have provided the code here as a reference. For more details,
refer to [SeqIKPy](https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/sequential-inverse-kinematics).
